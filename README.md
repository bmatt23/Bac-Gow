# Bac-Gow
This game is a hybrid of Pai-Gow-Poker and Baccarat. It takes from Baccarat in that you bet on the outcome of the table. It follows the rules of Pai Gow poker, just without Jokers. 
To start, hit "Deal New" in the top left. The game then presents you with payouts for the potential outcomes of the table. Type in a bet, and then click "Bet" to lock it in. 
Now, you hit "Next Card" until the top of the window prompts you to redeal. If you get the amount of hands won by the dealer or player right, you win!
Good luck
